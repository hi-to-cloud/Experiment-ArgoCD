```
AWS ALBs can be used as an L7 Load Balancer for both UI and gRPC traffic, 
whereas Classic ELBs and NLBs can be used as L4 Load Balancers for both.

When using an ALB, you'll want to create a second service for argocd-server. 
This is necessary because we need to tell the ALB to send the GRPC traffic 
to a different target group than the UI traffic, 
since the backend protocol is HTTP2 instead of HTTP1.
