Ingress Controller
------------------
If we want give internet access to our app running in K8 we have to provison ingress controller. 
We are using ALB as our ingress controller. We installed aws load balancer controller drivers through helm charts and given appropriate permissions.

Classic LB:
    - not intelligent
    - can't route traffic to different target group
    - it is not recommend by AWS

ALB:
    - its intelligent
    - it route traffic to multiple target groups based on host or context rules
    - it workson layer-7 


Step1: create OIDC 
Step2: create Policy
Step3: create IAM Role & K8s service account
Step4: add helm repo
Step5: install aws-load-balancer-controller 
Step6: create ingress resource
